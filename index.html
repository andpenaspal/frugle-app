      Frugle is a smart shopping companion designed to help you spend less without thinking harder.
      By connecting meals, products, and real prices, Frugle turns everyday grocery shopping into
      informed decisions. Over time, it helps you build better habits, reduce waste, and take
      control of your food budget — one shop at a time.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Add the products you buy, save your favorite recipes, and plan your meals ahead.
      As you shop, scan barcodes and log prices to build your personal price database across
      supermarkets. When it’s time to shop, Frugle automatically turns your meal plans into
      a smart shopping list — picking the cheapest options and grouping them by store, so
      you always know where to buy and how to save.
